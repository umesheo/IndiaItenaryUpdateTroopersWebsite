                                    <p>Trading is a survival zone. An effective trader has a trading schedule, a trading log, and they have built a mechanism on which they can rely to uncover trades that are more possible. To help you become a successful trader, here are some positive strategies that you can implement:
                                      <br>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li><p>Effective traders rely on the net success of their trade, rather than dwelling on their losses. Regardless of the defeats they face, they exchange because they trust in their scheme and in their chances of winning.</p></li>

                                    <li><p>Their level of continuity and patience gives them trust in their trading practices and feeds on themselves. They know itâ€™s part of dealing when they lose a deal, and they don't hesitate or get upset or sad.</p></li> 

                                   <li><p>Efficient traders follow the golden rule that they should not lose more than 2% of their money in order to maximize their odds of winning.</p></li>

                                   <li><p>They don't let their thoughts impact their trade. Depending on greed or terror, they do not deal.</p></li>

                                  <li><p>They religiously observe their trading strategy - they should not enter a deal because it is against their trading plan.</p></li>

                                  <li><p>The purpose sets the tone as to how you can transact. Once the targeted return of active traders is reached for the week, they do not enter another exchange or lose a lower portion of their resources if they do.</p></li>

                                  <li><p>The comfort space prevents us from seeing our dreams come true. Successful merchants are not frightened. To further their growth, they do what is required.</p></li>
                                </ul>

                                   <p>Nepal, being a beautiful nation with a rich culture and a great history, has a lot to offer the trade industry. Nepal needs faster and sustained growth in the trade sector, as Nepal's economy is lagging behind even after it has so much more capability to yield in the commercial sector. India, China, Bangladesh and the USA are Nepal's major trading partners. Clothing, carpets, crafts, leather and jute goods, vegetables and cereals are mainly exported by the country. Nepal imports goods, machinery & equipment and electronics.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Nepal faces the issue of a rising trade deficit. Imports are growing steadily, but the growth in exports is very small. Nepal is struggling to take advantage of commercial globalization. It would be beneficial to focus first on goods using primarily unskilled labour in the process of industrialization, with eventual upgrades in the commodity composition of exports as the nation accumulates physical and human resources. International trading helps Nepal to transcend the restrictions of its domestic markets by maximizing economies of scale and ensuring maximum capacity usage while preventing the problem of constructing ahead of demand and running at a low level of capacity utilization.
                                    <br><br>
                                    When a trade is developed more local demands need to be created which increase employment opportunities. The rich nations' currency is reliable, so international trade helps us to gain this foreign currency by exporting our products. Many nations can purchase our crafts, retain our traditional art and craftsmanship, and inspire young people to practice them. Trade would also enable technologies to be exchanged between countries. Mutual interaction between various countries is encouraged through Foreign Trade. It induces an environment among the trading countries of goodwill and friendship. The spirit of competitiveness among entrepreneurs is encouraged by international commerce. Foreign trade induces large-scale development and thus creates economies of scale.  
                                    <br><br>
                                    Trade leads to high demand and decreases global costs, and gives consumers advantages by improving the buying power of their own profits which contributes to an increase in market surpluses. Free and fair trade has encouraged vibrant competition, creativity, and economies of scale, allowing cheaper costs and greater choice for individuals and companies to take advantage of. Nepal is inherently blessed with an abundance of raw materials, culture and tradition, so Nepal can take advantage of its potential and improve Nepal's economy.</p>

                                    <p>China is Nepal's second largest trading partner. Historically, foreign trade has been limited to Tibet and the East India Company. Nepal's relationship with China is ancient and profoundly rooted. The Peace and Trade Treaty was agreed with Tibet during the time of Pratap Malla. Nepalese trading agencies in Tibet were bound to Xigaze, Gyirong, and Nyalam after 1956, with trade markets listed for Lhasa, Xigaze, Gyangze, and Yadong. Nepal and China, however, decided in 1980 to open 21 new trading routes across the Tibetan frontier. Treaty agreements with China specifically control the movement of merchants and pilgrims in any direction across the frontier. 
                                    Ties between Nepal and China have always remained warm and gracious. Friendliness, empathy, joint action, solidarity and respect for the sensitivities of each other have characterized the relations between the two countries. Nepal and China have a long history of frequently sharing high-level visits that have helped strengthen and consolidate bilateral relations. In order to sustain frequent ties and exchange views on matters of common concern, both countries have used bilateral, international and multilateral forums to host meetings between representatives. Overall exports to China stood above US$ 23 million in 2017/18. Nepal's trade deficit with China has been increasing. The biggest source of foreign direct investment in Nepal is China. On October 24-29, 2018, the 16th Nepal-China Economic and Trade Fair for Tibet was held in Lhasa. Chinese investors have pledged to spend more than $8.3 billion.
                                    China has long established ties on the basis of equality with Nepal. In their efforts to secure sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, they consistently support Nepal. China and Nepal have worked together very well and have achieved great achievements. Relationship between China and Nepal have grown more smoothly. The top leaders regularly exchanged visits, and the two countries cooperated smoothly. Strengthening partnership of mutual benefit and fostering collective prosperity are joint goals and represent the mutual interests of Nepal and China.
