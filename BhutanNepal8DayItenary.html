Drukpa Gunlie is a saint widely revered by Bhutanese. For a mad holy monk, this place is a holy place for child-seeking. After many years of childless believers have been blessed by a lama here, they will be pregnant when they return. The wisdom of the saint’s enlightenment is very high. He traveled throughout Tibet and Bhutan throughout his life. He used unique poems, humorous tones, and even ridiculous behaviors to promote the Dharma and benefit students. His method is very different from the social customs of the time. However, he revealed to people the true meaning of Buddhism. When people listened to him, they were like watching a humorous drama sketch. They laughed forward and backward, and at the same time, they could understand the essence of Buddhism.

Today, we are going to feel that happiness is neither far away nor unreachable, nor is it a godsend that can be obtained at will! Depart to Bhutan’s most sacred [Tiger’s Cave Temple], known as one of the top ten temples in the world, and a holy land for the practice of Padmasambhava. It is built on the cliffs of the gorge over 900 meters, and you need to walk up to the mountain for more than 2 hours. People who are not used to sports usually find it a little difficult; but as long as your heart returns to the present and unlocks your inherent potential, you will find that the road to happiness may be a bit like climbing a tiger's cave temple! I hope you not only enjoy the beautiful scenery, but also get the wonderful experience when you reach the top! With your pious heart, you can also feel the ubiquitous blessings of Guru Rinpoche's body, speech and mind! After descending from the mountain, head to the oldest temple in Bhutan [Chichu Temple] to visit. The great Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche once presided over this temple. The eight-year-old Sakyamuni Buddha enshrined in the temple is one of the most sacred Buddha statues in Bhutan. First, it was built in the same era as the Potala Palace in Tibet and is equally outstanding.

It is a city where old and new buildings coexist, just like Europe in the Middle Ages, old but not heavy. The local folk customs are simple, surrounded by lakes and mountains, and the scenery is exceptionally beautiful. Because it is located on the southern slope of the Himalayas, this natural barrier shields the city from the cold wind from the north. The southern part of the city faces the warm current of the Indian Ocean. The unique geographical environment makes the annual average temperature around 20℃. The climate is pleasant, sunny and green all year round. With lush trees and blooming flowers, it has the reputation of "paradise in the mountains" and is a world-famous tourist attraction. The most prosperous Thamel (Thamel, commonly known as "Laowaijie") is the base camp for tourists from all over the world to Nepal. It is not only a foreign-related tourist area set up by the Nepalese government in Kathmandu, but also a good place to experience Nepalese culture. The colorful decorations, thin sarees and the smiles of the residents on the street complement each other, forming the most authentic and simple Nepalese song.</p>
